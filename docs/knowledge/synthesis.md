# The Athena initiative

## The three foundations of Athena:
1. Constant restructuring (refactoring) of scienctific knowldege.
    + Restraining the spontaneous increase of scientific noise (entropy).
2. Sharing state-of-the-art science transparently and unpretentiously.
    + Reducing inaccessibility of scientific knowledge and bombastic rhetoric.
3. Governing scientific knowledge of the people, for the people, and by the people.
    + Decoupling knowledge from journal publications (validation, advertisement, and promotion).

## The lab's Athena is the synthesis of the current lab's knowledge
+ Narrative and visual synthesis of the scientific knowledge accumulated by the lab over the years.
+ Connection with other Athenas and repositories.
