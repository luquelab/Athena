# Luque lab: Mission

The [Luque lab](https://www.luquelab.com) is a research organization interested in the role that viruses played in the origin of life on Earth and the role that viruses could play in the expansion of humankind in the universe. The lab is part of the [Viral Information Institute](https://viralization.org), the [Computational Science Research Center](http://www.csrc.sdsu.edu), and the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.sdsu.edu) at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu).

An integral part of the lab's vision is the development of a new generation of researchers with a common foundation on scientific craftsmanship, human pshychology, and communication. The lab recognizes that scientific specialties are temporary and modern researchers must embrace change as an integral part of their contribution to society.
