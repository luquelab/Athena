# Open positions in the lab

## Postdoctoral Position in Computational Biophysics in San Diego

The [Viral Information Institute](https://viralization.org) has an open postdoctoral fellowship in computational biophysics funded by the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org) to investigate the origin of viruses. The research is at the interface of physical virology, viral ecology, and viral evolution, and it will combine geometrical modeling, molecular simulations, and bioinformatics. The ideal candidate would have experience modeling biological systems and a good foundation in mathematics and physics. In addition, experience in molecular dynamics would be a plus. The fellowship could start as early as January 2, 2022, and last up to three years.

The postdoctoral fellow will join an interdisciplinary group with four principal investigators: [Forest Rohwer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ALEZEdoAAAAJ), [Rob Edwards](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=e7fvl1kAAAAJ), [Anca Segall](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=p1mzR2gAAAAJ), and [Antoni Luque](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ytvnI68AAAAJ&hl=en). In addition, the postdoctoral fellow will collaborate with a diverse group of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students as part of the [Viral Information Institute](https://viralization.org) at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu).

Please, email Antoni Luque at <aluque@sdsu.edu> if you need any additional information. To apply to the fellowship, send an email with the subject "GBMF postdoc candidate" and include a letter of motivation, CV, and three contact references.

The announcement is available online at this [link](https://luquelab.github.io/Athena/organization/recruiting.html), which will reflect any updates.
