The lab has three organizational principles.
First, people come before science. The lab's mission is only meaningful if it empowers individuals and promotes an inclusive, equitable, and mindful organization.
Second, only a constant synthesis effort can reduce the natural increase of complexity and noise when researching individual projects: the second law of thermodynamics is inevitable. Thus, the lab must revise and simplify the rules, practices, and acquired knowledge periodically.
Third, the human mind can learn new skills and habits in any discipline. The lab uses knowledge from cognitive science to help individuals understand the flaws of the human mind when doing science and how to integrate new habits towards improvement.
