## The [Luque lab](https://www.luquelab.com) investigates the physical origin, ecology, and evolution of viruses.

[Site under construction]

The lab's long-term mission is to decipher the role that viruses played in the origin of life and use this knowledge to help humankind explore and habit new frontiers. The lab is part of the [Viral Information Institute](https://viralization.org), the [Computational Science Research Center](http://www.csrc.sdsu.edu), and the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.sdsu.edu) at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu).

The current lab approach is based on computational modeling, combining mathematics, statistics, and biophysics with experimental collaborations. An intrinsic part of the lab's mission is training a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers with a solid foundation in scientific crafting, metacognition, and rapport.

This is a new site under construction. It has a repository in GitHub and is generated with GitHub pages. The migration of our [prior lab's website](https://www.luquelab.com) will be completed in January 2022.
