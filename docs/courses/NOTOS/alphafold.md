# **Alphafold on Notos Sever**

[Luque Lab](https://www.luquelab.com/team.html) uses [Alphafold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold) for protein folding. AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence system developed by Google subsidiary DeepMind. It is designed to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins, which are essential components of all living organisms. AlphaFold uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the amino acid sequences of proteins and make predictions about their shapes and structures. It represents a significant breakthrough in the field of computational biology and has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of biology and disease.
