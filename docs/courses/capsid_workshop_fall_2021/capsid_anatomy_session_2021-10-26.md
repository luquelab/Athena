# Session 1: Capsid molecular model from cryoEM map (White lab)

## Recorded zoom session
+ [Public recording with integrated audio transcript.](https://SDSU.zoom.us/rec/share/w3gXBfrrL0ut-_Gv1pfw0nupA8_EhQjHWFEcq4aoGnXtCfnfRKxB-lFukMhkmChU.cuKmYYbXrLwjBkTk)

## Agenda

### Part 1: Model building

Brief overview of maps:

Mention differences between cryoEM and crystallography (one is where the map is the data and the other you need to solve the structure). I would only focus on cryoEM maps. Mention it is probably worth using Isolde to re-refine existing cryoEM structures. Probably not worth it for structures worse than 4 Angstrom.

Talk about where to get raw data from if you want to re-do the whole analysis (might be worthwhile for older data sets). Talk about EMDB and EMPIAR. Won’t discuss data analysis here but happy to have one-on-one sessions to teach people. 

Talk about phenix and CCPEM and the sharpening of cryoEM maps. CCPEM is a pain to install on mac. Also can’t handle the very large maps.

Map preparation for model building:
+ Brief overview of model building
+ Show chimera and chimerax.
+ Show coot. Show how to get Oli Clarke trimmings.
+ Run through model building on coot. Talk about asymmetric unit

Talk about using alphafold/ITasser/Phyre2 to make an initial model or de novo.
	
		
### Parts 2 and 3: Model refinement

+ Use coot to start refine
+ Use phenix for refinement
+ Use Isolde for refinement
+ Use PDB validation server for final checking: Need to show an image of amino acid with C alpha and C beta.
