# Session 2: Capsid Geometrical Anatomy (Luque lab)

## Recorded zoom session

## Main session points

### Part 1: The Capsid Anatomy Athena

The Athena initiatve:
+ Share technical state-of-the-art science transparently.
+ Synthesize scienctific knowldege (provide big picture) to complement encyclopedic knowledge.
+ Decouple evolving scientific knowledge from publications, which are snapshots of science necessary for validation, advertisement, and promotion.

Temporary Athena site for the Capsid Anatomy project:
+ GitHub repo: <https://github.com/luquelab/auto-lattice>
+ Online public documentation: <https://luquelab.github.io/auto-lattice>

Capsid anatomy:
+ Capsid composition and stoichiometry: major capsid protein, minor capsid protein, scaffold, reinforcemen proteins, and decoration proteins.

Functions other than major capsid protein are usually fuzzy!
+ Capsid diameter, surface, volume, and asphericity (internal and external)
    + Chimera tools: ...
+ Capsid geometric architecture: Lattice and T-number (icosahedral) , Lattice T-number, and Q-number (elongated),...
    + Chimera tools: hkcage 

How to assign T-numbers:
+ Criteria 1 (Diana): Shape and stoichiometric correspondence between geometric tiles and protein clusters.
+ Criteria 2 (Colin): Mechanical correspondence between geometric tiles and quasi-rigid protein domains.
+ The auto-lattice protocol aims to offer an automatic strategy with human validation.
+ Show example (5uu5) and current outputs.
+ Give insight so far: what looks like a trihex on the surface is a solid hex interiorly: The fish scale mechanism of HK97-fold proteins.


### Part 2: Current auto-lattice (criteria 1)
+ More manual than automatic.
+ It will represent our first effort.

### Part 2: Quasi-rigid domains (criteria 2)
+ A potentially more automatic approach.
+ Challenge with large capsids.
