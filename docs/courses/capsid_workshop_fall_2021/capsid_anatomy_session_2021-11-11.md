# Capsid Geometrical Anatomy (Luque lab)
November 11, 2021

### Zoom session
+ To be added.
+ Agenda:
    + Part 1: Toni Luque provides an update and vision about the tools that the Luque lab has been developing to predict the structural phenotype of viruses from genomic information.
    + Part 2: Diana Lee leads a demonstration on how to predict the capsid architecture of tailed phages from their genome.
    + Part 3: Diana Lee leads a demonstration on how to predict the capsid architecture of tailed phages from their major capsid protein gene.

### Access to the main files for the session
+ [Lee et al. pre-print](https://luquelab.github.io/Athena/courses/capsid_workshop_fall_2021/images/2021-11-11/Lee_et_al_manuscript_submitted_2021-10-01.pdf): This pre-print introduces the genome-to-T number and MCP-to-T number models and investigates metagenomically assembled gut phage genomes.
+ [VAN: Virus Anatomy Navigator](https://github.com/luquelab/VAN): This GitHub repository is the umbrella of the different genotype-to-phenotype viral structural tools that the Luque lab has or will develop.
