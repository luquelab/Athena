# **GitHub Repositories**
- Repository/ Repo is another word for a project and can have multiple files in it.
- Go through this tutorial to familiarize yourself with repositories: [Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

## Keywords 
- Commit
  - A commit is an individual change to a file similar to saving a file. Each commit can have a note/ message with it and allows you to keep a record of all the changes made until that moment. Each commit has it's own commit hash which is the unique identifier for that particular commit.

- Branch
  - Branches allow you to experiment with your project without changing the main project. Once you edit a file in your branch it won't be uptaded in your main master branch until you create a pull request and merge the branch.

- Pull requests and merge
  - If you decide to keep the changes made in the branch into the main branch you send a oull request to merge the current branch. Once the request is accepted the branch is merged into the master.
 
- Forks and Pull requests
  - Forking is making a copy of a repository or an instance which is not yours and having it under your account without affecting the original version. You send in a pull request if you want to contribute your changes back to the original. It is up to the main account holder to accept or reject the pull request.
