# GitHub to official website 

The lab website is available in two versions. The GitHub Pages version can be accessed at [https://luquelab.github.io/website/](https://luquelab.github.io/website/) and it contains the latest lab accomplishments. The main website, [https://www.luquelab.com/](https://www.luquelab.com/), is built using a third-party website generator called Weebly. Both versions provide valuable information about the lab and its activities.
