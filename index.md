The [Luque lab](https://www.luquelab.com) is a research organization interested in the role that viruses played in the origin of life on Earth and the role that viruses could play in the expansion of humankind in the universe. The lab is part of the [Viral Information Institute](https://viralization.org), the [Computational Science Research Center](http://www.csrc.sdsu.edu), and the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.sdsu.edu) at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu).

An integral part of the lab's vision is training a new generation of researchers with a common foundation in scientific craftsmanship, human psychology, and communication. As a result, the Luque lab researchers are equipped to embrace change in their careers as an integral part of their contribution to society.
